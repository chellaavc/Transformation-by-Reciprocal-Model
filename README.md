The objective of this project is to apply the Reciprocal Transformation Model to the housing dataset in order to improve the accuracy and interpretability of the analysis. The dataset includes variables such as the median home value (**MEDV**), percentage of lower-status individuals (**LSTAT**), and the number of rooms per dwelling (**RM**). Since housing prices (**MEDV**) often exhibit skewed distributions with extreme high values, and relationships between variables like the number of rooms and home values tend to be non-linear, the reciprocal transformation is used to normalize these distributions and linearize the relationships. By doing so, the project aims to reduce the impact of extreme values, stabilize variances, and better capture diminishing returns, ultimately resulting in a more reliable and accurate model.
